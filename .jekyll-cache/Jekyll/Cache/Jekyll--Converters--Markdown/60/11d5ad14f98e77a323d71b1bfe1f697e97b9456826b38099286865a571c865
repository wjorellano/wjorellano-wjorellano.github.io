I"'<p>I wake up at 8:30 at that time I get up to shower and clean at 9 I start to organize my room then I check my emails to read or answer a message while I have a coffee.</p>

<p>At 9:40 after breakfast I go back to a virtual course, work on some pending application or series while I wait for the time to go to the university.</p>

<p>Being in the university I take my classes one after the other so as not to waste time that could be dedicated to better things, my time to leave the university is at 7:30 or 9:00 pm and I return home at 10:00 or 11 :00 at night.</p>

<p>From Monday to Thursday after I get home from university I check the platform to see the jobs I have pending or I go back to what I was doing in the morning and on Fridays my group of friends waits for me to go out to a nightclub.</p>
