<p>At 9:40 after breakfast I go back to a virtual course, work on some pending application or series while I wait for the time to go to the university.</p>

<p>Being in the university I take my classes one after the other so as not to waste time that could be dedicated to better things, my time to leave the university is at 7:30 or 9:00 pm and I return home at 10:00 or 11 :00 at night.</p>

<p>From Monday to Thursday after I get home from university I check the platform to see the jobs I have pending or I go back to what I was doing in the morning and on Fridays my group of friends waits for me to go out to a nightclub.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="daily-routine" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wake up at 8:30 at that time I get up to shower and clean at 9 I start to organize my room then I check my emails to read or answer a message while I have a coffee.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to my blog</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/welcome/2022/07/29/welcome-to-my-blog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to my blog" /><published>2022-07-29T18:06:11-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-29T18:06:11-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/welcome/2022/07/29/welcome-to-my-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/welcome/2022/07/29/welcome-to-my-blog.html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I’m Willman Orellano and I’m 20 years old.
